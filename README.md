# CZW1-GodMode
Integrated personal ai assistant 


Godmode Project

Godmode is an open-source project aimed at creating a secure, unified profile that integrates multiple accounts and services under one independent platform. The goal is to provide users with a centralized, encrypted environment to manage their digital life with enhanced security, privacy, and automation features.

Key Features:

Account Integration: Manage multiple accounts from the same site without confusion. Securely store, encrypt, and organize sensitive data, including login credentials, bookmarks, favorites, and collections.

Enhanced Security: Implements robust security protocols like SSO, 2FA, MFA, and containerization. Built with encryption at its core, the system ensures data is protected both locally and in the cloud.

Automation & Connectivity: Automatically connect to a VPN, synchronize across platforms, and utilize cloud backups for redundancy. The project supports localization and auto-forwarding of emails across profiles.

AI-Driven Logging: Incorporates AI-powered activity and production logs to track daily events, generate customizable reports, and provide insights into your digital activities.

Open-Source & Modular: Primarily free and open-source, Godmode can be tailored to individual needs through containerization (Docker, Portainer) and supports integration with various third-party apps and services.


Current Status:

Godmode is in the early stages of development and is currently set up on a virtual machine running Pop!_OS with Docker and Portainer for easy management. The next phase involves building a Raspberry Pi cluster for hardware hosting and enhancing cross-platform integration.

Future Plans:

Develop a centralized access point for all email addresses and profiles.

Introduce deeper AI-UX/UI integration for automation and personalization.

Expand encryption methods and VPN integration for improved user security.


Join the Godmode project on its journey to simplify and secure your digital ecosystem.

The provided script is designed to set up multiple services on your system, including Mailcow (email server), Nextcloud (file storage), OnlyOffice (office suite), and an AI service using Flask. Here’s a breakdown of what each section does, specifically considering you will be installing it on Pop!_OS:

Breakdown of the Script

1. System Update and Package Installation:

The script starts by updating the system and installing essential packages such as Docker, Docker Compose, Git, Certbot (for SSL management), and Python dependencies required for the AI service.

Pop!_OS, being a Debian-based distribution, is compatible with these package installations.



2. Docker Setup:

It initializes Docker and ensures it starts automatically on system boot.



3. Mailcow Setup:

Clones the Mailcow Dockerized repository and runs the configuration script to set up the email server.

Pulls the necessary Docker images and starts the Mailcow containers.

Configures Mailcow to use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates, enhancing security for email communication.



4. Nextcloud and OnlyOffice Setup:

Creates a Docker Compose setup for Nextcloud, which allows users to store and share files.

Sets up a separate Docker Compose for OnlyOffice, which provides document editing capabilities.

These services are also set to run in containers, making them easy to manage and update.



5. Authelia Security Setup:

Configures Authelia, a two-factor authentication server, to secure access to your applications.

It assumes that you will modify the configuration as needed for your specific domain and security requirements.



6. AI Service Setup:

Sets up a basic AI service using Flask, which allows you to make queries to a GPT-2 model for generating text-based responses.

The AI service runs on a specified port and can be expanded further as per your needs.



7. Nginx Configuration:

Installs Nginx to handle HTTPS traffic and forwards requests to the appropriate Dockerized services.

Configures SSL using Let's Encrypt certificates obtained earlier in the script.

Redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS to ensure all communications are secure.



8. Final Configuration and Access Instructions:

After all installations, the script provides URLs for accessing each service, now secured with SSL.




Specific Considerations for Pop!_OS

Compatibility: The script is compatible with Pop!_OS, as it is based on Ubuntu, which means all the commands and package management operations will work seamlessly.

User Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands (you might need to add your user to the Docker group).

Firewall Configuration: Check the firewall settings to allow traffic on the required ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and any other custom ports).

System Resources: Ensure your Pop!_OS machine has adequate resources (CPU, RAM, and storage) to run all these services concurrently, especially if you plan to use them actively.


Running the Script

To run the script on your Pop!_OS system:

1. Save the Script:

Create a new file and copy the script content into it, for example, setup_all_services_ssl.sh.



2. Make It Executable:

chmod +x setup_all_services_ssl.sh


3. Run the Script:

sudo ./setup_all_services_ssl.sh



Post-Installation

After running the script, you should:

Test Access: Use a web browser to navigate to the services using the provided URLs and ensure they are accessible.

Monitor Services: Check the status of Docker containers using:

sudo docker ps

Renew SSL Certificates: Ensure SSL certificates are set to renew automatically with the provided cron job.


If you have any specific configurations or additional services you’d like to add or modify in this setup, feel free to ask!
