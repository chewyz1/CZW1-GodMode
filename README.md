Godmode Project

Godmode is an open-source project aimed at creating a secure, unified profile that integrates multiple accounts and services under one independent platform. The goal is to provide users with a centralized, encrypted environment to manage their digital life with enhanced security, privacy, and automation features.

Key Features:

Account Integration: Manage multiple accounts from the same site without confusion. Securely store, encrypt, and organize sensitive data, including login credentials, bookmarks, favorites, and collections.

Enhanced Security: Implements robust security protocols like SSO, 2FA, MFA, and containerization. Built with encryption at its core, the system ensures data is protected both locally and in the cloud.

Automation & Connectivity: Automatically connect to a VPN, synchronize across platforms, and utilize cloud backups for redundancy. The project supports localization and auto-forwarding of emails across profiles.

AI-Driven Logging: Incorporates AI-powered activity and production logs to track daily events, generate customizable reports, and provide insights into your digital activities.

Open-Source & Modular: Primarily free and open-source, Godmode can be tailored to individual needs through containerization (Docker, Portainer) and supports integration with various third-party apps and services.


Current Status:

Godmode is in the early stages of development and is currently set up on a virtual machine running Pop!_OS with Docker and Portainer for easy management. The next phase involves building a Raspberry Pi cluster for hardware hosting and enhancing cross-platform integration.

Future Plans:

Develop a centralized access point for all email addresses and profiles.

Introduce deeper AI-UX/UI integration for automation and personalization.

Expand encryption methods and VPN integration for improved user security.


Join the Godmode project on its journey to simplify and secure your digital ecosystem.
